I've spent the past few days trying to wrap my head around dependency injection. What is it? Why should I care? Nearly every
Android Architecture Components guide that I've found has in some way uses Dagger 2, Android's most popular dependency injection
framework. As I continue to teach myself Android development and my code becomes harder to maintain, test, and scale as I implement
new content, I am forcing myself to learn things like Android design patterns (MVVM, MVP), Android Arch Components, Dagger 2, and
more. 

This video presentation by Daniel Lew, a software engineer at Trello, is the most informative resource I've found to learn about dependency injection on Android with zero prior exposure to the
programming design pattern.
