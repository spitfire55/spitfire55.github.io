This page will contain a large list of resources I have found useful across various topics like Android development, exploitation, CTF competitions, and more.

First, see my [reading list]("https://spitfy.re/readinglist") for the books I am reading this year.

Next, see my [OSCP Certification Review](https://spitfy.re/OSCP-PWK-Course-Review-and-Resources/) for some resources that help you complete various pentesting tasks like writing a simple reverse shell in multiple languages, privilege escalation on both Linux and Windows, and a great guide to learning how to use Metasploit written by Offensive Security.
