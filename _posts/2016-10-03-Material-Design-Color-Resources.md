title: Material Design Color Resources
description: An assortment of colors and design principles to use in mobile and web development.
---

So as I began experimenting with different color combinations for this website (which started off as a pretty obnoxious sky blue color),
I wanted to ultimately collect a solid list of resources that will prove helpful for my future Android development endeavors. I found
the following websites to be very helpful in selecting and visualizing color combinations that are based on Material Design guidelines.    
<br />  

## Android
* [Google's Official Material Color Palette](https://material.google.com/style/color.html) - Definitely the best place to get started
when researching what colors are standard in a Material Design UI. Great variety of colors, and also explains the do's and don'ts of 
implementing various things like accents and colored text. 
* [Material Design for Android Developers (Udacity)](https://www.udacity.com/course/material-design-for-android-developers--ud862) -
This Udacity course takes approximately 4 weeks. It is taught by Google and is free. In the class, you learn how to apply the material
design principles to apps. One of the lessons, "Bold Graphic Design", teaches students how to effectively use color, imagery, and fonts
in coordination with a certain style and theme.

## General Design
* [Uplabs](https://site.uplabs.com/) - Website for designers and developers to share interfaces and designs for Android, iOS, and web. 
Lots of inspiration from over 50,000 designers and developers who are showcasing their best designs. Great way to see how certain color
combinations actually look in a finished mobile or web product.
* [Material Palette](https://www.materialpalette.com/) - Very simple but powerful website. Select two colors and you instantly see a
preview of those colors used in a mobile application. The first color is the primary color, and the second color is the accent. Good
for planning simple application interfaces (i.e. Contacts and ToDoist).
* [Material UI](https://www.materialui.co/colors) - Another great Material Design color palette. There is not a preview options like
Material Palette. However, the main attractive feature of this site is that clicking on a color instantly displays its hex value,
which enables developers to quickly copy and paste the respective hex value into their app or CSS file. Another cool feature is an
additional palette called Social Colors, which lists the primary colors of the most popular social media applications.

As I find more resources that I believe are useful, I will add them here. Happy coding!
