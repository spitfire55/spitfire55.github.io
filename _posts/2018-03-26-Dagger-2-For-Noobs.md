title : Dagger 2 for Noobs
description : Following up my previous post on dependency injection, I want to link the best resource I've found so far to learn Dagger 2

My pursuit to learn modern Android development practices like Android Architecture Components, Android-specific design
patterns (MVVM, MVP, etc.), and Kotlin have led me to what I think is one of the most intimidating programming concepts
I've learned thus far: dependency injection. In my previous post, I linked an amazing YouTube video that teaches
dependency injection to an Android developer audience but with an introduction to DI component that is better than a lot
of blog posts and other resources I've found.

This follow-on post is meant to take the basics from that video and move on to more in-depth illustrations. After a few
days of digging around, I found this great Medium post that provides a lot of diagrams and breaks everything down to the
actual implementation in Java. The high-level diagrams in conjunction with Android-specific code are super helpful.

Here is part one of the three-part Medium post:
