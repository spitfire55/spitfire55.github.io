title: Gary Vaynerchuk All in on YOU
description: I'm a big fan of Gary's content. Here is one of his many solid YouTube clips.

Gary Vaynerchuk is a self-made millionare who uses social media as the primary differentiator between himself and the rest of the business world. He strikes at the heart of the intersection between technology and business in a manner that allows him to create his own personal brand on YouTube and Snapchat, run a multi-million dollar marketing agency, and have a multi-million dollar angel investment fund.

Here is one of his videos talking with a guy looking for some advice on creating personal content. In general I just love watching his videos before I go to bed because it puts my various activities into a larger perspective and forces me to think about my future from a 30,000 foot view rather than just being stuck in the weeds all day. Enjoy!
