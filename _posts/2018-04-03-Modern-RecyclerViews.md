In my pursuit of adopting modern Android development practices, I am learning how to move away from the spaghetti code I have used
to implement RecylerViews into my applications. Just like my work researching dependency injection, I am trying to understand and
follow modern Android practices. 

I've done some very simple Android development in the past, usually following tutorials or just learning the basics through
Coursera or other online courses. In those tutorials, along with many online introductions, the examples are simple on purpose. So
as I began work on my CTF Time app, I quickly started to see how much my RecyclerView and adapter code was not scaleable as it
turned into complex switch statements with other spaghetti code bouncing around between a half dozen different classes. Given that
I was just starting to create the underlying functionality and had not even gotten to the advanced stuff like animations or
gestures, I quickly realized I needed to scrap all of the RecyclerView-related work and use a more scaleable solution.

After a day or so of research, I found the following DroidCon 2016 presentation by Lisa Wray at Genius.com. She gives practical,
easy-to-follow visual examples with the corresponding Java code to explain new features and best practices in implementing
RecyclerViews.
