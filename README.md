# Spitfire55 Personal Blog

This repo will be used to host my personal research and development blog. I will not post anything regarding answers to existing competitions or challenges until they are no longer live. For long-term competitions (i.e Cyberstakes), I will simply post resources used to solve the challenges.

Mainly, this will be a way for me to organize my thoughts as I conduct cyber security research and start creating Android applications.
