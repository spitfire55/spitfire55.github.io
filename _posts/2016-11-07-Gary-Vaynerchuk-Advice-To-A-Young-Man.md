Gary Vaynerchuk is a self-made millionare who uses social media as the primary differentiator between himself and the rest of the business world. He strikes at the heart of the intersection between technology and business in a manner that allows him to create his own personal brand on YouTube and Snapchat, run a multi-million dollar marketing agency, and have a multi-million dollar angel investment fund.

Here is one of his videos where he speaks with a young man seeking advice on monetizing personal content. In enjoy watching a couple of his videos before I go to bed because it puts my daily work into a larger perspective. It allows me to think about my future from a 30,000 foot point of view rather than solely being stuck in the weeds for 18 hours a day. Enjoy!
