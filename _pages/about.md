My name is Dale Lakes. I am a student at The United States Military Academy at West Point. I am a senior student in computer science.
After graduation, I will be a commissioned second lieutenant in the United States Army and join the Cyber branch.

My interests include information security, specifically memory and disk forensics. I also enjoy reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and cryptography.

I also enjoy the Android operating system and the new Daydream virtual reality platform. As soon as I got my first Nexus phone, I became a "root junky", flashing custom ROMs and other customizable features. I now am beginning to learn how to develop my own Android apps, and hope to publish my first app on the Play Store by the end of 2016.
