My name is Dale Lakes. I am a student at The United States Military Academy at West Point. I am a senior student in computer science.
After graduation, I will be a commissioned second lieutenant in the United States Army. I hope to join the Cyber branch.

My interests include information security, specifically memory and disk forensics. I also enjoy reverse engineering, binary exploitation,
and cryptography. I am a member of the CTF team [Bits For Everyone](https://ctftime.org/team/2511).

I also enjoy the Android operating system. I used to root my phone, flash ROMs, and customize almost everything on my phone. Nowadays I
am looking to get into Android development. I really enjoy using Material Design (hence my blog theme).
